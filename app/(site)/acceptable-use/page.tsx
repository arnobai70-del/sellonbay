      <h2>What happens</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone can report a site on the <Link href="/report-abuse">abuse report page</Link>. Reports reach our admins. A hosted site that gets several independent reports from verified accounts is
        paused until an admin has looked at it. Admins can suspend a site or an account at once. Chat messages that share contact details are blocked. After {CONFIG.chat.warnAtBlocks} blocks in{' '}
        {CONFIG.chat.windowDays} days you get a warning, and after {CONFIG.chat.suspendAtBlocks} your account can be suspended.
