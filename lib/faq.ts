      { q: 'Do I need to know how to code?', a: 'No. You choose a site and give us your domain. The seller deploys it and shows you how to change text and images.' },
      { q: 'Who owns the domain?', a: 'You do. The domain is registered in your name, and you can move it any time.' },
      { q: 'How long does it take?', a: 'Between 1 and 3 days from payment to a live site. An express option (24 hours) is available for an extra fee at checkout.' },
      { q: 'Can I change how it looks?', a: 'Yes. Ask the seller who built it. Brand swaps, extra pages and custom features have a fixed price that you pay into escrow before work starts.' },

        q: 'What if the site does not match the demo?',

      },
      {
        q: 'Can I get a refund after I accept?',
        a: 'Accepting makes the order final, so check carefully during your 48-hour review. Problems with security, copyright or a site that stops working are still covered by our bug-fix guarantee for 7 days.',
      },
      {
        q: 'When do I get the source files?',
        a: 'During the 48-hour review you check the live site on your own domain. The source files are released to you when you accept, or when the review ends and the order is accepted for you.',
      },
      {
        q: "Why can't we chat or pay outside SellOnBay?",
        a: 'Payments made outside are not protected. Messages with emails, phone numbers or outside payment requests are blocked, and repeat attempts can end in a ban.',

    title: 'Selling a site',
    items: [
      { q: 'How do sellers get paid?', a: 'Every week we pay out all earnings that have been accepted for at least 7 days. You choose a bank transfer or Payoneer.' },
      {
        q: 'What does SellOnBay charge?',
        a: `We keep ${FEE_SALE_TEXT} of each sale and ${FEE_CUSTOM_TEXT} of custom, extra and trial work. Buyers pay no service fee. Domains and hosting are optional extras.`,
      },
      { q: 'Can I sell the same site again and again?', a: 'Yes, that is the idea. Each buyer gets a personal license and you keep ownership. Buyers may not resell or copy it.' },
      { q: 'How are listings checked?', a: 'We scan your files for malware and copied content, check that the demo works, and reply within 24 hours.' },
