# Deployment and database setup

Owner's rule (2026-10-20): all work is prepared in this GitHub repository. Nobody applies a migration, changes the live Supabase database, deletes or resets data, deploys or restarts the live site, or changes production environment variables without the owner's written permission for that step. This file is the order to follow once that permission is given. A unit test (`tests/unit/deployment-doc.test.ts`) fails when a migration file is missing from the list below.

## 1. What can be checked without a database

Run these on every change. CI runs them on every pull request.

| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Lint (0 errors) | `npm run lint` |
| Types | `npm run typecheck` |
| Unit tests | `npm test` |
| Every migration, in order, in an in-process Postgres | `npm run check:migrations` |
| No new migration loses data or breaks the running site | `npm run check:migration-safety` |
| Production build | `npm run build` |
| No secret in the browser bundle | `npm run check:bundle` (after a build) |
| Demo server smoke test | `npm run smoke:demo` |
| Blue-green script plan and switch (stand-ins, no server) | `node --test deploy/blue-green.test.mjs` |
| Browser tests in demo mode (no database) | build with `LAUNCHBAY_DEMO=1`, start on port 3002, `npm run test:e2e` (the real-server tests fail without port 3000; that is expected) |

## 2. What needs a staging database (later)

These tests create users, orders, ledger entries and files, so they run only against a separate staging Supabase project, never production. See `docs/STAGING_GATE.md` for the guard (`scripts/verify-staging-target.mjs`) and the manual GitHub workflow.

- Browser tests against the real server (port 3000 with `.env.local` pointing at **staging**): `admin`, `buy-real`, `chat`, `extras`, `guard`, `handover`, `listing`, `orders`, `presale`, `privacy` and `rls` in `tests/e2e`.
- `tests/e2e/delivery.e2e.cjs` (real file delivery).
- Module maintenance with the real table: switch a module on in the Maintenance Manager, restart the app, and check it is still closed. Then check the row and its history in `module_maintenance` and `module_maintenance_history`.

## 3. Migration order

Apply the files in `supabase/migrations/` strictly in number order, each one once. Never edit a file that has been applied; fix forward with a new file. As far as this repository records, the dev project had 0001 to 0040 applied on 2026-10-09. Check the real state first in the Supabase dashboard: Database → Migrations, or the `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` table.

| 0048_posts.sql | Blog posts with meta title and description |
| 0049_module_maintenance.sql | Module maintenance and its history |

Almost every file only adds or tightens. One exception: 0016 drops the old `wallets` and `ledger_entries` tables from 0001 and rebuilds the ledger, so on a database that already holds money records, back up and read 0016 before running it. Files 0043, 0045 and 0047 remove client write rights. After them, check that sellers can still save listings through the site, because the site writes through the server.

### Migration safety

During a deploy the old site keeps running for a while on the new database (and with blue-green both versions run at once), so every new migration must leave the old code working. `npm run check:migration-safety` (in CI, rules in `scripts/lib/migration-safety.mjs`) fails when a migration after 0049 drops a table, column, type or schema, empties a table, deletes rows, renames a table or column, changes a column type, makes a column required, or adds a required column with no default. Files up to 0049 are history and are not checked again; the ones that did such steps are listed above.

Do these changes in steps instead:

- **Rename:** add the new column, copy the data, let the code write both, and drop the old column only in a later release.
- **Required column:** add it with a default, or add it as optional, fill it, and make it required in a later release.
- **Remove a table or column:** first ship code that no longer uses it, then remove it in a later migration.

If a destructive step is really needed, take a backup, get the owner's written agreement, and put `-- destructive-ok: <why, who agreed and when>` on the line just above that one statement.

## 4. Applying migrations (only with permission)

1. Do it on **staging first**: a separate Supabase project with the same files. Run section 2 there.
2. Back up production: `npm run db:backup` (see RUNBOOK "Backups"), and the dashboard backup if the plan has one. Keep the backup outside GitHub (the repository is public).
3. Apply the missing files in order, one at a time (`supabase db push`, or paste each into the SQL editor). Stop at the first error and do not continue.
4. Apply the migrations **before** deploying the code that needs them. Every file only adds, so the old code keeps working on the new database. A few features check for their table and fall back to this server's memory until it exists: orders, admin settings, SEO words and module maintenance. Other features expect their migration to be there.
5. After the migration, open `/dashboard/admin/launch` and `/dashboard/admin/maintenance`. The maintenance screen must no longer say "Saved in this server's memory only".

## 5. Deploying the site (only with permission)

The hosting plan is not decided yet: a Hostinger VPS or Hostinger's Node.js web hosting.

- **Today (one app instance):** pull `main`, `npm ci`, `npm run build`, restart the Node process. The site is down for the few seconds the restart takes. Before a risky change, put only the affected module into maintenance (Admin → System → Maintenance Manager), not the whole site.
- **Zero downtime (needs a VPS):** blue-green with `deploy/blue-green.sh`. Hostinger's Node.js web hosting runs one copy only, so there the "today" way above stays. The scripts are ready in the repository but have not been run on any server.

### Blue-green on a VPS

Two copies of the site live side by side, `blue` (port 3101) and `green` (port 3102), each in its own folder under `/srv/sellonbay`. nginx sends visitors to one of them. A deploy builds the new version in the copy that is not serving, starts it, checks `/api/health` on its own port, and only then points nginx at it (nginx checks the new setting with `nginx -t` first and keeps the old one if it is refused). The old copy keeps running, so going back is one switch. If the new copy does not answer, visitors never leave the old one.

One-time setup (with the owner's permission):

1. Install Node 22, nginx and git. Create a `sellonbay` user and `/srv/sellonbay` owned by it.
2. Put the production variables in `/etc/sellonbay/env` (readable only by `sellonbay` and root). Create `/etc/sellonbay/port-blue` containing `PORT=3101` and `/etc/sellonbay/port-green` containing `PORT=3102`.
3. Copy `deploy/sellonbay@.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`, then `systemctl daemon-reload` and `systemctl enable sellonbay@blue sellonbay@green`.
4. Adapt `deploy/nginx-sellonbay.conf.example` (server name, certificates) and create `/etc/nginx/sellonbay-upstream.conf` with `server 127.0.0.1:3101;`.
5. Behind nginx, set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1` so rate limits see the visitor's address (`lib/clientIp.ts`); add one more hop if Cloudflare is in front too.
6. Point the cron jobs at the public address (as today), so they always reach the copy that is serving.

Each release:

1. Apply any new migrations first (section 4). `npm run check:migration-safety` keeps them safe for the copy that is still running.
2. `deploy/blue-green.sh deploy` (or `deploy/blue-green.sh deploy <tag or commit>`). `DRY_RUN=1` prints the plan without doing anything.
3. Check the site. If something is wrong: `deploy/blue-green.sh rollback`. `deploy/blue-green.sh status` shows which copy serves and whether each one answers.

Both copies read the same database, so module maintenance applies to both within 10 seconds (the cache in `lib/maintenance/state.ts`). Orders and payments are written by whichever copy gets the request, through the same state machine and ledger, so a switch does not lose or double them.

Environment variables are set on the host, never in GitHub. `/dashboard/admin/launch` lists which ones are set (names only, never values).

## 6. Rolling back

- **Code:** go back to the previous build (blue-green: `deploy/blue-green.sh rollback`; one instance: check out the previous commit, build, restart).
- **Database:** migrations are not reversed. Fix forward with a new migration. Restore a backup only as a last resort, with the owner (RUNBOOK "Restore a backup"), because it loses everything written since the backup.
- **One module misbehaving:** close only that module in the Maintenance Manager. If no admin screen opens, run `update module_maintenance set enabled = false;` in the SQL editor to reopen every module.
