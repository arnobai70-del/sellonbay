        <h2>How it helps</h2>
        <p>
          Most small business sites need the same few things: say what you do, show what it costs, and make it easy to get in touch. The pages we suggest follow what works for the kind of business you
          describe. The domain names are short, easy to say and easy to spell.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A bakery in Dhaka that sells cakes and bread: a menu page, online ordering or booking, a catering page.</li>
          <li>A photographer who shoots weddings: a gallery of your best eight pieces, a hire-me page with prices, a short story about you.</li>
          <li>A dentist with two chairs: appointment booking, a team and services page, patient reviews.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        {FAQ.map(([q, a]) => (
          <div key={q}>
            <h3>{q}</h3>
            <p>{a}</p>
