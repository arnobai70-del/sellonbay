        <li>What you own, with a link to the original.</li>
        <li>The link to the listing or site you say copies it.</li>
        <li>A statement that you believe in good faith the use is not allowed, and that your notice is accurate.</li>
        <li>Your signature (typing your full name is enough).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>We may pause the listing while we look. We tell the seller, who can answer the claim. Sellers who repeatedly copy other people&apos;s work are removed.</p>

      <h2>If you think we got it wrong</h2>
      <p>Sellers can send a counter-notice to the same address. A lawyer must check this process before launch.</p>
